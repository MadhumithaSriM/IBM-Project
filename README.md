TEAM LEAD: REEBA SURENDRAN

Assignment 1

   Build a smart home in Tinkercad with 2 sensors, an Led, buzzer and submit it.
   
Assignment 2:

   Build a python code, Assume u get temperature and humidity values (generated with a random function to a variable) and write a condition to detect an alarm in case of high
temperature continuously.

Assignment 3:

   Write python code for blinking LED and Traffic lights for Raspberry pi.
   
Assignment 4:

   Write code and connections in wokwi for the ultrasonic sensor. Whenever the distance is less than 100 cms send an "alert" to the IBM cloud and display in
the device recent events.
